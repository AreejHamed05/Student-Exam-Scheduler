# 🗓️ Student Exam Scheduling System

A powerful C-based scheduling program that manages **students**, **courses**, and **exam halls** using arrays, loops, and string parsing. It lets users input data about students and exam dates, then apply 10+ different filters and queries to retrieve structured info.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Stores student IDs, course codes, exam dates, and hall numbers
- Lets users query:
  - Number of students per course
  - Hall usage per date
  - Students attending on a certain day
  - Dropped courses or conflicts
- Organizes data using arrays, conditionals, and ASCII parsing

---

## 🧠 My Role

- Built core functions for filtering student/hall/date data
- Parsed complex string inputs using nested loops and ASCII checks
- Designed logic for leap year calculations and custom queries
- Handled input/output logic and formatting
- Debugged edge cases and optimized loops
